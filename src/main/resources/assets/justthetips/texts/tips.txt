Don't play this pack.
Don't do the quests.
Give up.
You're going to fail.
You'll never overcome the Chaos.
Hug a creeper.
You can't win.
Go swim in lava.
Join the zombie horde.
You'll regret this.
If you don't play, you can't lose.
Run away. Run as far as you can.
Listen to the fear. Give in to it.
This is too hard. It's not worth it. No one will care if you just give up.
Your first mistake was thinking you had a chance. Now is the time to reconsider.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
Do you remember the last time you were happy and life was filled with hope? This isn't going to be like that at all.
Start crying now.
